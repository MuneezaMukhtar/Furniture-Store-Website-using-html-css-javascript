# Furniture-Store-Website-Using Html-Css-Javascript
I created a Furniture Store website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on delivering a visually appealing and functional online shopping experience. The website features a clean and modern design that showcases various furniture products with detailed descriptions and high-quality images. Using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements, the site provides users with an intuitive navigation experience and dynamic product displays. Key functionalities include a user-friendly product catalog, filtering options, and a responsive layout that ensures seamless access across different devices. The site aims to offer an engaging and efficient platform for customers to explore and purchase furniture effortlessly.
